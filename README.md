# terraform-project
This was a project that I wanted to do. I started with a course on youtube from freecodeCamp.org. Then expanded on what I learned from that course. I wanted to get the experience of writing code with IaC. There was a bit of research for the firewall part. I came across a repository with the firewall code there. Mr. ricoaws. Understanding how to set it up and what rule(s) I would have for it. Also, referring to the Terraform Documentation to setup the rest of the code. As i was creating this, I wanted to also learn Ansible. So, I incorporated it in the the build of the code. Therefore learning both skills as I built out ths project. This was a great project for me to lear both skills and now get to use them. Hope you enjoy the code. Thank you.
